# Village-Simulator-2

This is a remake of my old village simulator that will be used to test my current programing skills. The premise of this project is to create an active village simulation that includes features like breeding, structures, life cycles and skilled work.

## Other things of Note

1. This will be used in part to test my programing skills for school so do not expect anything specacular out of it YET.
2. This is my first personal prject on GitHub and my first major public one.
3. I am not an expert just want to have some fun.

## Premise

Make a Village Simulation with the following features.
* Breeding Mechanics
  * Inbreeding discouaged
* Villager Jobs
  * The more a villager works the better they become
* Buildings
  * Storage
  * Work
  * Living
* Aging
  * Cap at 500
  * Breedable at 20 (There is no comfortable way to put that is there)
